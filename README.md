# quick-open-create README

## NOTE: This extension is currently work in progress. Consider this an alpha release.

quick-open-create makes it easy to open and create new files relative to the
currently open one and browsing the directories without leaving the keyboard.

## Features

quick-open-create will give you an easy way to show and and select the siblings
of the current file to open it, or create a new one. This is really helpful when
dealing with component based projects where you have related files next to each
other. eg: scss, html, js and some config file.
