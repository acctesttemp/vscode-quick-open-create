# smartopenfile README

## NOTE: This extension is currently work in progress. Consider this an alpha release.

smartopenfile is an extension that makes it easy to open and create new
sibling files to the currently open one.

## Features

smartopenfile will give you an easy way to show and and select the siblings
of the current file to open it, or create a new one. This is really helpful when
dealing with component based projects where you have related files next to each
other. eg: scss, html, js and some config file.
